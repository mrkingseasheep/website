            I guess this is the first post ever on this website. Aside from the
            obligatory 'hello world' that everyone writes, what else do I want
            to put here? Most websites would start with something generic like
            going over why they created the website, their goals, what they plan
            on doing, and since I'm such a creative genius, I'll copy that
            format exactly.

            I guess this is the first post ever on this website. Aside from the

            to over why they created the website, their goals, what they plan on
            doing, and since I'm such a creative genius, I'll copy that format
            exactly. As you can tell, this website's gonna be full of totally
            non-generic, trying too hard to be quirky, cutting edge,
            avant-garde, new and improved, buzzword choked,
            innovative-buisiness-disrupting-hyperefficient-600%-APR<i
                >onceinalifetime</i
            ><b>BUY-NOW-GET-ONE-FREE</b>
            content. I'm sure that you can tell that I don't really have a plan
            for this website, in fact I'm 99%, no, 97% sure that most of the
            stuff I post is going to be low quality shitpost equivalent stuff.
            But hey, if you wanna stick around for the giggling shits, be my
            guest. I love getting external validation on the internet! (except
            you can't comment on this page because I don't understand how
            javascript works)
        </p>
        <h2>OK Seriously Bro, Why Are You Doing This?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm sure most people have heard of enshitification by now. If you
            haven't, congrats, you probably aren't on the internet 24/7! (and if
            that is true, how on earth did you manage to find this anti-SEO
            optimized website among all the other shit?) Enshitification means
            that companies have gradually made their products more and more,
            well, shit. Besides physical things being lower quality and
            constantly breaking, there's also the shittiness of modern content.
            Actually that statements a lie, there's still banger content around,
            it's just content that's even slightly worth our time to watch is
            buried underneath a mountain of shit, most of which can be directly
            attributed to AI. Which brings me to the thesis and guiding
            principal of this channel. If you're gonna consume shit, might as
            well make it human shit.
        </p>
        Well...
        <p>
            Maybe not the guiding principal. Now you might have noticed that I'm
            no wordsmith by any means and the sheer amount of times I've used
            the word shit probably flags this website as a scatalogical fetish
            site to Google (which if that's why you're here, I'm sorry to
            disappoint). This website will be shit and I'm willing to admit
            that, but is there really that much of a difference between this or
            a polished shiny turd? If it's all slop anyways, I'd much rather
            connect with a human in the process instead of a poorly diguised
            Raid Shadow Legends sponsorship. Consume. Human. Shit.
        </p>

            Time to drop that metaphor. (speaking of, is it a metaphor? or is it
            just bad writing? clearly English class didn't teach me enough)
        </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Digital nomads. Passive income. Passport bros. I'm sure some aspect
            of those hustle-grindset bros (and gals) has wormed itself into my
            unconsenting subconcious self and now I feel the sudden urge give
            out unasked for financial advice and sell a course. Now I'd actually
            have to be tripping hard to believe that this website's ever going
            to make money. However, I do think that having an online portfolio
            would be at least somewhat good for my non-existent professional
            life.
        </p>
        <p>
            A part of me wants to share stuff with the world. Or should I say
            void? There's something comforting knowing that this website will
            likely never be shown on the first 20 pages of Google. I suppose I
            just want to hide inside obscurity. At the very least, it gives me
            the confidence to post my projects without that intense feeling of
            judgement. Going back to my goals, I want to just post some stuff on
            the internet and to show off a little bit. Even if it feels like my
            thoughts are being swallowed whole by the bottomless gut of some
            long snake (I need to work on my metaphors), the action itself is
            theraputic. There's just something comforting about screaming into
            the void because you know the void will never scream back.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from posting my projects and inane rambling, I also think that
            this is my chance to revolt against the increasingly hostile
            internet. While everything becomes dominated by search engines and
            alogrithms, I just feel an intense dread as we march forwards into a
            monolithic internet where some remote supercomputer controls your
            entire social network, feed, and everything you see. Now I'd like to
            say this next part came to me in a dream and I'm some messiah or
            something, but alas it came from a Youtube video that was
            algorithmically recommended to me. The video was exploring old
            websites and at the bottom of one of the sites there was a
            collection of buttons that linked to the website creator's friends.
            It was such a novel idea to me at the time. Instead of the almighty
            alogrithm deciding everything I should look at, I could use my
            friends as slave labor, and force them to pan for gold in the
            streams of the internet. Machine recommendations could be replaced
            by human suggestions. That's why I'm strongarming my friends into
            setting their own websites so I can link to them and carve out our
            own niche part of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rant aside, here's a briefer outline of where I plan on taking this
            website (this is mostly for me not you, you stalker):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Document the design, build and outcome of one personal project
            </li>
            <li>Make a blog post on anything</li>
            <li>
                Force 3 friends to create their own website and button link to
                them
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a book review with recommendations, fanfic? and stupid
                theories
            </li>
            <li>Post some film photography</li>
            <li>Record and add some piano music to the site</li>
            <li>Be less cynical</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Like a bad ex...</h2>
        <p>
            Having finish my daily rant, I'd just like to warn you one final
            time. This website will be fickle. It's probably gonna only get
            updated when I feel extremely bored and/or want to rant about
            something. Chances are I'll get bored of this within a week tops and
            end up doing something else so I wouldn't stick around if I were
            you. But hey, maybe that's the secret to longevity. Maybe our desire
            for good content, for reliable, weekly content is what got us into
            this place in the first place. To force someone to be creative is
            like trying to pet a cat. The more you reek of desperation, the less
            it'll come to you. Creativity isn't a tap that can just be wedged
            open, unlike the unending torrent of slop from the AI bot farms. So
            if you are interested in anything I had to say, stick around. Who
            knows, maybe you'll just randomly remember this site at 3 AM and
            give it a check. Visit whenever you want. Not like I'm getting ad
            revenue or anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            All that being said, I do want to set up RSS ASAP so you'll actually
            know I didn't abondon this project 3 days into starting it.
