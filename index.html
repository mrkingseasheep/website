            There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just
            fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones.
            That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine. Lorem ipsum odor

                    <h2>Hello!</h2>
                    Unmotivated 18 year old here! Like so many others, I was
                    feeling disappointed with AI slop that was getting pushed
                    out onto the internet, so I wanted to retaliate by createing
                    my own website. Even though it'll be shitty, at least it's
                    human. Stay tuned for random shenanigans.

                    This'll either be an attempt at being unique and quirky or
                    the most angst filled pathetic article ever. Pick your
                    poison.
